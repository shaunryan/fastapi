# https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/simple-oauth2/
# OAuth2 specifies that when using the "password flow" (that we are using) 
# the client/user must send a username and password fields as form data.
# for the login path operation, we need to use these names to be compatible with 
# the spec (and be able to, for example, use the integrated API documentation system).
# The spec also states that the username and password must be sent as form data (so, no JSON here).

# scopeÂ¶
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# The spec also says that the client can send another form field "scope".
# The form field name is scope (in singular), but it is actually a long string with "scopes" separated by spaces.
# Each "scope" is just a string (without spaces).
# They are normally used to declare specific security permissions, for example:

#     users:read or users:write are common examples.
#     instagram_basic is used by Facebook / Instagram.
#     https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive is used by Google.

# Info:
#   In OAuth2 a "scope" is just a string that declares a specific permission required.
#   It doesn't matter if it has other characters like : or if it is a URL.
#   Those details are implementation specific.
#   For OAuth2 they are just strings.

# OAuth2PasswordRequestForm is a class dependency that declares a form body with:
# 
#     The username.
#     The password.
#     An optional scope field as a big string, composed of strings separated by spaces.
#     An optional grant_type.
# 
# The OAuth2 spec actually requires a field grant_type with a fixed value of password, but OAuth2PasswordRequestForm doesn't enforce it.
# 
# If you need to enforce it, use OAuth2PasswordRequestFormStrict instead of OAuth2PasswordRequestForm.
#     An optional client_id (we don't need it for our example).
#     An optional client_secret (we don't need it for our example).
# 
# Info
#   The OAuth2PasswordRequestForm is not a special class for FastAPI as is OAuth2PasswordBearer.
#   OAuth2PasswordBearer makes FastAPI know that it is a security scheme. So it is added that way to OpenAPI.
#   But OAuth2PasswordRequestForm is just a class dependency that you could have written yourself, or you could have declared Form parameters directly.
#   But as it's a common use case, it is provided by FastAPI directly, just to make it easier.
